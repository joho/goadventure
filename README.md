## Wat?

One day this will be the finest twitter based novelty text adventure engine in all the lands.

Right now it's a git log of embarrassment as I learn a new programming language. When it's a bit further along, I'll ask for some help/feedback, but for right now just let me struggle along myself.

## Licence

I haven't decided yet, for right now consider it plain old copyright.
